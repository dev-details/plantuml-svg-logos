# Add a logo

## Find an SVG URL

Searching for "{brandname} svg logo" in Google is usually enough.

This site tends to come up the most in the results:

- https://worldvectorlogo.com/

Another place to look is the brand website's presskit or marketing material.

Once you find the logo, check the brand's website to make sure it's the 
current logo.

Copy the URL to the SVG then run:

    .build/convert1.sh <sprite_name> <svg_url>

# Preview logo

    .build/preview.sh <sprite_name>
